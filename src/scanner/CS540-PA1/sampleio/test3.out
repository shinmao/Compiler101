     For this first assignment, you are going to use Lex to 
write a preprocessor to take input text and make it look 
presentable. This is to be your own individual effort. The 
output must adhere to the following rules: 

     
     * The input text should be output as lines with length 
       as close as possible to 60 characters without 
       exceeding this number. Words should not be cut to 
       meet this requirement. 
     
     * Be careful to keep special symbols that can appear at 
       the end of a word (period, question mark, exclamation 
       point, semicolon, comma, colon, close parenthesis, 
       close quote), symbols that can appear within words 
       (apostrophe, @ and .), and symbols that can appear at 
       the start of a word (open parenthesis, open quote) on 
       the same line as the word. 
     
     * If a word contains a hyphen, that hyphen should be 
       used to break a word across lines IF the word is too 
       long for the line and the part of the word up to and 
       including the hyphen fits. 
     
     * In the input text, paragraphs are separated by one or 
       more blank lines. For the input file, a blank line is 
       defined as zero or more blanks and tabs followed by 
       an end of line marker ( n). In the output text, there 
       must be a single line separating paragraph. In 
       addition, the first line of each paragraph should be 
       indented 5 characters. 
     
     * No line should begin with blanks unless it is the 
       start of a paragraph. Multiple blanks should be 
       transformed to a single blank. 
     

     A line starting with the ' ' character indicates a list 
item. Everything on the line is part of the given list item. 
A list item starts with the character indented 5 spaces 
followed by a single space then the item. The item itself 
needs to be cut across lines adhering to the 60 character 
rule. The second and following lines will be indented 7 
spaces shown in the online examples. Any text following the 

     
     * Any other special characters that are not mentioned 
       above should be removed. Note Be sure you are using 
       Lex effectively. If you are writing a lot of C Java 
       code to manipulate the matched input, you are not 
       making Lex do the work. 
     

     And now a final paragraph
